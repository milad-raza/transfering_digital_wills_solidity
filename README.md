# Transferring Digital Wills Solidity Smart Contract

Wills, power of attorneys, signing authorities, and other such crucial documents have massive value and can bring many businesses and families down on their knees with a breach.

While the traditional wills are vulnerable to thefts and manipulations by the managers, will participants and other people, using blockchain for transferring and managing them settles the bill effectively!

What can blockchain do?

Blockchain will have a decentralized record of will, assets, people, and all the stakeholders.
Whenever a change is done by the original owner of the assets, the same is visible to all the other parties, including the law office (lawyer, etc).
No fraud can be committed and no change can be made until the original owner agrees.
Hence, digital will creation and management is one of the bankable upcoming blockchain projects.
